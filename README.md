# New Architecture OS
Write a OS kernel is my dream, when i learned programming. Now, i will finish my dream. Haha.

Daydreaming a senior student. But it's not "Daydreaming", because i think it's not hard at present.

Now, So i have a lot of knowledge that i can finish this project. 

Hiahia :-), by the way, this project can be used as my paper!

Update: 

Time: Tue Oct 23 13:50:26 CST 2018. 

Work: Rebuild directory structure, finished "kprintf" function and finished memory detected.

## How to build it?
The maintain build frame at root directory's 'Makefile' file for this project.</br>
You can read this file to understand compilation details. The 'Makebranch' file</br>
is only "branch" at subdirectory, it also 'makefile' file.</br>
You can type command `make qemu` to build this project. Then you should look at the 'qemu' emulator is running.</br>
It means your 'Operating System' is running, when the qemu emulator was ran.</br>
Unfortunately, this 'Operating System' is not completed. Because i have not enough time and knowledge :-(.</br>
